        "This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Yes Bank stock price trends, capturing key financial and market data that help investors, analysts, and researchers understand the stock’s behavior over time. The dataset includes historical prices, daily open-high-low-close (OHLC) values, trading volume, adjusted closing prices, and other market indicators. The goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project is to uncover patterns, evaluate performance, and provide actionable insights into the behavior of Yes Bank stock prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "The banking sector is one of the most dynamic components of the financial market in India. With the rise of digital banking, evolving regulations, and market fluctuations, it is important to analyze stock performance to make informed investment decisions. Yes Bank, being a private sector bank with a turbulent history including a financial crisis and recovery phases, serves as a rich case study for stock price analysis. This project aims to evaluate trends, volatility, recovery phases, trading volumes, and correlation with broader market indicators such as Nifty Bank and BSE Sensex indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used contains daily stock prices of Yes Bank over a multi-year period (e.g., from 2015 to 2025), covering significant financial events like the 2020 restructuring, Moody’s credit rating changes, and stake acquisition by institutional investors. This data was sourced from publicly available stock exchange data and includes approximately 2500+ trading records.\n",
        "\n",
        "After loading the dataset, I performed data preparation and cleaning. This included handling missing values, checking for outliers in the price data, and filtering non-trading days (weekends and holidays). I also computed several additional features such as moving averages (e.g., 20-day and 50-day), relative strength index (RSI), and daily returns. Several null values were handled by forward fill or by removing non-impactful records.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure smooth visualization and analysis, date columns were converted to datetime format and sorted in chronological order. Duplicate records, if any, were dropped. I calculated key financial metrics such as average monthly closing price, volatility, and standard deviation of returns to better understand risk factors associated with Yes Bank's stock.\n",
        "\n",
        "After data cleaning, various exploratory data analysis techniques were used to visualize stock behavior. Univariate analysis was performed on closing price, volume, and returns. Bivariate analysis helped compare stock prices with trading volume and moving averages. Multivariate analysis included correlation matrices between technical indicators to determine relationships among volatility, RSI, and return trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different types of charts such as line graphs, candlestick plots, bar charts, and rolling average trends were used to present insights. Time series decomposition helped to identify seasonality and trends. Additionally, key financial events such as RBI interventions, capital infusion, and FII activity were mapped to price movements to observe cause-effect relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the Yes Bank Stock Price EDA project provided deep insights into the stock's performance during critical events, including phases of decline and recovery. It revealed that Yes Bank’s volatility peaked during the 2020 financial crisis and gradually stabilized post-capital restructuring. The project also uncovered patterns such as increased trading volume during positive rating revisions and significant price rebounds following institutional investment news.\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings are useful for investors, financial analysts, and economists in identifying high-risk periods, optimal entry-exit points, and in predicting future price behavior. It also highlights how sentiment, regulatory action, and institutional confidence play key roles in stock price recovery in distressed banking stocks. The analysis can support the creation of predictive models or investment strategies tailored to bank stock trading."

        "Stock market investors and financial analysts often struggle to gain actionable insights from raw stock price data due to the lack of an efficient and intuitive analysis system. This limitation hinders their ability to make informed investment decisions, manage portfolio risks, and respond to market changes promptly. In particular, tracking the historical trends and volatility of specific stocks—such as Yes Bank—requires a comprehensive analysis framework that offers detailed visualizations, comparisons, and statistical breakdowns of stock performance over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, there is a growing need to develop a robust stock price analysis system focused on Yes Bank that can address these challenges. Such a system would enable users to analyze daily price movements, trading volume, moving averages, and return distributions effectively. By integrating data visualization, statistical summaries, and financial indicators, this platform can empower investors, researchers, and institutions to interpret stock behavior with clarity and confidence. Leveraging tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and machine learning techniques, the system can provide a solid foundation for informed financial decision-making in the dynamic and volatile stock market environment."
